# 🎵 React Playlist 👩🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0f963293-9a8f-4143-9fda-df218c4bf78c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/swfl-coders-playlist/deploys)

Helps us build our future events playlist. You can either modify this app to give it a better look or simply add a new song.
We all have a song that keeps up going. If you have to choose one, which one will be your favorite coding song?

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Pull down this repository**

   On terminal:
   For SSH
   `git clone git@github.com:swfl-coders/react-playlist.git`

   For HTTP
   `git clone https://github.com/swfl-coders/react-playlist.git`

2. **Start developing**

   Navigate into project and start up.

   ```sh
   cd react-playlist
   npm install -g yarn # if not already installed
   yarn install
   yarn start
   ```

   **NOTE:** Please don't commit the `yarn.lock` file unless you are installing dependencies. Use `git status` to check if any changes have been made after you `yarn install`. Ff you see `yarn.lock` has changes, please checkout the file with `git checkout yarn.lock`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser or might even open automatically.

3. **Deployment**

We are using **Netlify** for deployments. You can see the latest deploy version here: [SWFL Coders Playlist](https://swfl-coders-playlist.netlify.com/)

This project created with:

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- [react-youtube](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-youtube)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
